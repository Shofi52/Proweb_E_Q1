                    <b>10 November Museum (Hero's Museum)</b><br>
                    The tragedy on 10th November 1945 and another historical episode, 
                    made Surabaya well known as the Heroes City. It is one of the reasons it was built. 
                    Although there are many military statues in and around Surabaya, this one is certainly imposing. 
                    It's not ornate or even decorative, not particularly large, but its simplicity may have been the deliberate 
                    plan of its architect to convey humble, rather than bellicose pride. The monument becomes a centre of major 
                    attention every November 10th, 
                    the day in 1945 when Surabaya commemorates those heroes who died during the independence war. 
                    The 10 November Museum was built to explain the meaning behind the Heroes Monument. The building consists of 2 floors, 
                    with exhibitions symbolizing the spirit of the Surabayan people's struggle and is located under the monument
